Very very simple grid focused on lightweight and mobile only development. At this moment the compiled file weighs less than 0.5kb

This grid fits awesome for AMP development (only mobile sizes, no responsive) because they have a [limitation of 50,000 bytes for the weight of the CSS](https://amp.dev/es/documentation/guides-and-tutorials/develop/style_and_layout/?format=websites#add-styles-to-a-page).
